# Ui Coverflow

The jQueryUI Coverflow project seeks to create a fully functional 'CoverFlow' effect using a combination of jQuery, jQuery UI components and CSS3 transforms.

## Getting Started

`#: git clone https://github.com/basti1253/jqueryui-coverflow-ii.git ui-coverflow`
`#: cd ui-coverflow`
`#: git pull origin jqueryui19 && git submodule update --init`

Check out demo/index.html in your browser.

**please note**

This is highly experimental code. IE support temporarily dropped - I'll reinclude support after more testing/refactoring.

## automatic event binding:

This coverflow effect binds to the following events on initialization:

 - mousewheel
 - mobile swipe events
 - keyboard selection (tabbed)
 - items.click
 - items.focus


## public events:
 - beforeselect
 - select
 - orientationchange


**changelog:**

refactored internals:

 - options related:
    - add stacking property to options : 0 < x < 1
    - multiple trigger support, defaults to focus and click
    - removed center and recenter options (don't see a usecase here)
    - add animation related options: duration + easing

 - jQuery 1.8 related:
    - drop prefix testing

 - jQueryUI 1.9 related:
    - add jQueryUI 1.9 bindings
    - add destroy method (needs testing)
    - allow orientation change by providing _init() (needs testing + custom event)

 - internals:
    - use easier assignments (dropped props-Property)
    - whitespacing - see jQueryUI code guidelines
    - add: beforeselect event
    - fix: move select event trigger - triggers after animation finished
    - fix: animation stop - jump to end
    - fix: currentIndex assignMent
    - refactored internals to make the code DRY
    - moved demo/lib related files
	- fix itemscale
	- cleanup dirs
	- added jQueryui dist files
	- added jshint (use `npm install -d` and run `make test`)

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt).

### Important notes
Please don't edit files in the `dist` subdirectory as they are generated via grunt. You'll find source code in the `src` subdirectory!

While grunt can run the included unit tests via PhantomJS, this shouldn't be considered a substitute for the real thing. Please be sure to test the `test/*.html` unit test file(s) in _actual_ browsers.

### Installing grunt
_This assumes you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/) installed already._

1. Test that grunt is installed globally by running `grunt --version` at the command-line.
1. If grunt isn't installed globally, run `npm install -g grunt` to install the latest version. _You may need to run `sudo npm install -g grunt`._
1. From the root directory of this project, run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies.

### Installing PhantomJS

In order for the qunit task to work properly, [PhantomJS](http://www.phantomjs.org/) must be installed and in the system PATH (if you can run "phantomjs" at the command line, this task should work).

Unfortunately, PhantomJS cannot be installed automatically via npm or grunt, so you need to install it yourself. There are a number of ways to install PhantomJS.

* [PhantomJS and Mac OS X](http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2012/02/phantomjs-and-mac-os-x.html)
* [PhantomJS Installation](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/wiki/Installation) (PhantomJS wiki)

Note that the `phantomjs` executable needs to be in the system `PATH` for grunt to see it.
